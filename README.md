# Epicycles

In short, produces animations of arbitrary shapes being drawn from Fourier Epicycles.
The shapes are provided as svg line-art as illustrated in example *drawing-1.svg*.

**Epicycle_Draw** is my own testing script for use in Atom-Hydrogen.
**Epicycle_Draw_Script** should be used in general.
